In Linux, users can be assigned to groups. Each user has a primary group, and they can also be members of additional secondary groups. Groups help with organizing permissions and access control. 

To add a new user to an existing group during creation: 


sudo useradd -G groupname username 

To add an existing user to a group: 

sudo usermod -aG groupname username 

Viewing User Information You can check a user's details using the id command. For example, to view john’s user and group information: 

id john 

This will output the user’s UID, primary group, and any secondary groups they belong to. 

Another way to view user information is by checking the /etc/passwd file, which contains details about every user account on the system: 

cat /etc/passwd 

Locking and Unlocking User Accounts If you need to temporarily prevent a user from logging in, you can lock their account: 


sudo usermod -L username



To unlock the account, you can run:

sudo usermod -U username



Changing User Passwords Changing a user’s password is straightforward with the passwd command. To change john’s password, run: 

sudo passwd john
