In Linux, users can be assigned to groups. Each user has a primary group, and they can also be members of additional secondary groups. Groups help with organizing permissions and access control. 

To add a new user to an existing group during creation: 


sudo useradd -G groupname username 

To add an existing user to a group: 

sudo usermod -aG groupname username 

Viewing User Information You can check a user's details using the id command. For example, to view john’s user and group information: 

id john 

This will output the user’s UID, primary group, and any secondary groups they belong to. 

Another way to view user information is by checking the /etc/passwd file, which contains details about every user account on the system: 

cat /etc/passwd 

Locking and Unlocking User Accounts If you need to temporarily prevent a user from logging in, you can lock their account: 


sudo usermod -L username



To unlock the account, you can run:

sudo usermod -U username



Changing User Passwords Changing a user’s password is straightforward with the passwd command. To change john’s password, run: 

sudo passwd john

In Linux, a group is a collection of users. Each user is assigned a primary group, and they can belong to additional secondary groups. Groups help in managing file permissions, where permissions can be set for individual users or for a group as a whole. 

There are two types of groups in Linux: 
●      Primary Group: The main group assigned to a user. 
●      Secondary Groups: Additional groups a user can belong to. A user can be part of multiple secondary groups.





You can view the groups a user belongs to using the id command: 

id username 

For example, to check the groups for user john: 

id john 

This will show the user’s UID (user ID), GID (group ID), and a list of groups the user belongs to.





Creating and Managing Groups with groupadd, groupdel, and gpasswd 

Linux provides several commands for creating and managing groups. The most common commands for managing groups are groupadd, groupdel, and gpasswd. 

a. Creating a Group with groupadd The groupadd command is used to create a new group. 

sudo groupadd groupname 

For example, to create a group called developers: 

sudo groupadd developers 

This will create a group named developers. You can now add users to this group. 


b. Deleting a Group with groupdel The groupdel command is used to delete an existing group. 

sudo groupdel groupname



For example, to delete the developers group: 

sudo groupdel developers


Note: This will only remove the group, but any user who was in the group will still have the group as a secondary group. You’ll need to manage user memberships separately.


Modifying Group Passwords with gpasswd The gpasswd command allows you to set a password for a group, although this is less commonly used in practice. 

sudo gpasswd groupname


For example, to set a password for the developers group: 

sudo gpasswd developers




Managing Group Membership with usermod and gpasswd You can add users to groups using the usermod command. 

You can also use the gpasswd command to manage group membership.

Adding a User to a Group with usermod The usermod command allows you to modify a user’s group memberships. To add a user to an existing group, you use the -aG option with usermod. 

sudo usermod -aG groupname username

For example, to add john to the developers group:

sudo usermod -aG developers john

The -a flag ensures that the user is added to the group without being removed from other groups.

Removing a User from a Group To remove a user from a group, you would modify their group membership using the gpasswd command or by editing the /etc/group file directly. However, usermod doesn’t have a direct option to remove users from secondary groups, so it’s easier to edit the /etc/group file or use gpasswd.
